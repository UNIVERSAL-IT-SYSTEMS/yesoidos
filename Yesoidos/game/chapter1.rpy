    me "Teacher, why are we here?" 

    "The walls of the teacher's home are simple drywall, painted a plain white. Here and there, crayon marks, cracks and dents color and texture the surface."
    "A chart of Hebrew letters hangs from a plastic hook near the door, around which my friends sit. There are about ten of us crowded in the tiny room, between three and five years old."

# [prz] Most of what's said in the above two lines will be visible on the background art anyway, so it's a bit redundant to state it in words as well. Just be sure to instruct your artist ;]
# --[mus] Agreed. I'll leave this in for now, as a note for the artist. As graphics are put in, these picture descriptions will disappear. 

    # zu = Zusha, the teacher
    zu "Why are you here? You're here to learn how to be good people, like your Mommies and Tatties. Alrright?"

    "I giggle at how he emphasizes and rolls his 'r' - {i}alrright!{/i}"
    "Zusha didn't give me the answer I was looking for." 
    "But, I forgot what I really wanted to ask. I'm only four, after all."

    zu "{i}Alrright!{/i} We're learning some more letters today! This is a {i}zayin{/i}. Can everyone say {i}zayin?{/i}"

    # ch = the children
    ch "{i}Zayin!{/i}"

    zu "Good! This is a very, {i}very{/i} important letter to learn, the {i}zayin{/i}. Does anyone know why?"
    "We are mystified. Everyone is paying rapt attention."
    zu "Because... it's the first letter of my name!"
    "Everyone laughs. Yossi is laughing so hard that he has started to hiccup, which makes everyone laugh even more."

    "As if by a miracle, Zusha continues the lesson, and everyone quiets down."
    "We all love Zusha the teacher."
    "Especially when he tells us stories."
    "If we learn our letters well, sometimes he'll tell us about really special people called {i}tsadikim.{/i}"
    "A {i}tsadik{/i} helps other people and cares for them, and he never does anything bad."
    "Because they are such good people, God has a special relationship with them. He answers their prayers and does miracles for them."
    # pn = Pinchus, "Pinny"
    pn "Oh! Benny, I think he's gonna start!"

    zu "Alkay. This is a story about the Baal Shem Tov. Ready? Here we go."
    
    "Everyone quiets down and shifts to see Zusha better."
    
    zu "A long time ago, there lived a married couple in a village called Okup. Eliezer and Sara were their names."
    "They were {i}tsadikim{/i}, but they were lonely because they had no child."
    "They {i}davened{/i} and {i}davened{/i} for a child, crying out to Hashem."
    "And Hashem heard their prayers."
    "He went to His treasury, carefully looked through it, and chose - a special soul for Eliezer and Sara to raise as a son."
    "He was just about to send the soul down to Earth, when a certain angel saw the soul that was chosen and spoke up."
    
    # st = Satan, the angel

    st "How do we know that those two really deserve to raise this soul as their child?"
    st "A soul like this may {i}not{/i} be given to just anybody!"
    # mc = Michoel, the angel
    mc "Be quiet! Who here doesn't know that you have been blocking this soul's way, for centuries now?"
    mc "You are afraid that its radiance and holiness could threaten your power!"
    st "And what of that?"
    mc "Are you expecting us to accept your word as objective? The truth of truths?"
    mc "If the soul were to be sent down, it could bring the era of {i}Moshiach!{/i} The culmination of all God's efforts in Creation!"
    mc "No one would die, no wars would be fought, and no one would wrong another again. The world would be filled with holy light and knowledge of God!"
    mc "In such a state, you and your doubtful services would be... unnecessary. Put simply, your testimony is tainted; so please excuse us, if we don't take your word at face value."
    mc "After all, your mission {i}is{/i} to hinder Man's quest to reveal God in the world."
    st "Of course, of course. I cannot deny that." 
    "Michoel smiled in victory, but only slightly. It seemed that Satan had something up his sleeve."
    st "However! If Divine revelation was {i}all{/i} that the Holy One wanted... wouldn't He have created the Earth that way from the start?"
    "The Satan lets the question sink in."
    st "After all, God is all-powerful. If His Will is to create, it is created. Why not create an Earth where God is already revealed?"
    st "Actually, I can go even further!"
    st "Why was the Earth created... {i}at all?{/i}"
    st "Here in Heaven, we already have the Divine Light and knowledge of God. Isn't this what the World is supposed to become like?"
    st "Why even bother creating the lower worlds?"
    st "Hmm? No one?"
    "The angelic court stood silent - in dread of the impending hammer-blow."
    st "Because - \"The Light born out of Darkness itself is {i}superior{/i} to any other Light!\" Hashem wants mankind to fight the Darkness and {i}transform{/i} it to Light! Not just have it drop down on their laps!"
    st "\"The Holy One, blessed be He, desired to have a home in the {i}lower{/i} realms,\" where God's presence is hidden! Specifically! Sound familiar, anyone?"
    "There was some reluctant nodding."
    st "That's why He created Man! That's why the World exists!"
    st "That's why the precious Torah, which was in Heaven for nearly two-and-a-half thousand years after Creation, and pre-existed Existence itself for two thousand more years -"
    "The Satan had struck a nerve. Protests and groans dominated the Supernal court until order was restored."
    st "That's why the Torah was taken from us... and given to {i}them!{/i}"
    st "That is why my mission - for I serve the Creator just as you do - is to create the Darkness. It is so that Man can defeat it!"
    "A stunned silence. Pained, the Satan dropped to a whisper."
    st "Yes! I {i}want,{/i} just like you all, that my Darkness be subdued."
    st "Here, in Oilom HoEmes, in the Realm of Truth, dishonesty does not exist. Search through me and see that this is true!"
    st "It pains me to cause Man to sin. Who, aside from the One, knows better than I how much damage Man causes when he sins?"
    st "How much pain this causes the Shechinah?"
    st "Yet, I am commanded by the Creator... to make the Darkness."
    mc "I sympathize with your lot. But, what is your point?"
    mc "If you truly desire the revelation of God, why do you prevent us from sending down this pure, radiant soul, which will accomplish exactly that?"
    st "The greatest Light comes from Darkness."
    st "To merit and appreciate such a great Light, an appropriate amount of Darkness must be subdued first. Eliezer and Sarah are not ready for this soul yet."
    mc "What slander! Of course they are ready."
    mc "Haven't you seen how they welcome guests to their house? They {i}hire{/i} people to welcome and bring visitors to their house! This alone merits a truly radiant soul as a child!"
    mc "And that is not all. Look at how much charity they give. They hardly have a kopek left for themselves!"
    mc "You say that you understand the Darkness. Do you then not understand the pain of poverty?"
    st "This is not enough. Serving G‑d with money is just one way. They must also show that they serve G‑d with all their heart and soul!"
    # hs = Hashem, God. 
    hs "Silence!"
    "The angelic court stood, trembling in awe as God spoke."
    hs "The Satan is right. A soul like this may not be given without the parents proving their worthiness."
    hs "Since the Satan was created to test mankind, it is hereby decreed that he shall design a test to prove the worthiness of Eliezer and Sara."
    hs "It is further decreed that if Eliezer and Sara pass the test, this soul shall be given to them, immediately, to raise as their son!"
    "And so it happened."
    "In the test, Eliezer and Sara were separated for many years in distant lands, enduring grueling trials of moral strength."
    "In the end, they passed the test, remaining faithful to each other and to God."
    "And so, that radiant soul was finally sent down to Earth."
    "This was the soul of the Holy Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov."
    "For nine months, Sara carried him in her belly. But all that time, the baby was unusually still."
    "A baby usually kicks in his mother's belly, but not this one."
    "He was so eager to start doing {i}mitzvos{/i} that even inside his mother's womb, he fulfilled the {i}mitzvah{/i} of honoring his parents."
    "He was still, to avoid bothering his mother as she carried him."
    "That's the kind of {i}tsadik{/i} he was."
    "When he was finally born, he was healthy and sound. At eight days old, his circumcision was a joyous affair."

    st "Too fast."
    st "I must slow his progress. By God's decree, I cannot take the boy's life. But..."
    st "It is the mother who instills love in the child. Maybe by taking her away, I can halt the boy's progress."
    st "Wisdom comes from the father. I can wait a bit to claim him; the boy is too young to learn Torah right now."
    "And so, while Yisroel was still a small child, first his mother, then his father passed into {i}Oilom HoEmes.{/i}"
    "The poor child Yisroel was on his own."
    "However, that did not stop his learning and growth."
    "His childhood was an intensely Godly experience. Having learned to read the Holy Tongue as fluently as an adult, {i}seforim{/i} like the Tehillim, Gemara and the Zohar came alive for him as he mouthed their teachings."
    "When he read \"You are my son - I have begotten you today,\" in the Tehillim of King Dovid, he heard God telling him that he was God's son."
    "When he read how God called out to Shmuel the prophet, he longed for God to call to him the same way. For him, learning was life, and life was learning."
    "But, even though he learned and felt more than probably anyone alive today, that was just a small part of who the Baal Shem Tov was."
    "Before Yisroel's father Eliezer left this world, there were two things he told his beloved son."
    
    el "Yisroelik..."
    # yb = Yisroel, Baal Shem Tov
    yb "Yes, Tatti?"

    yb "Tatti, you can't go!"
    el "Listen, Yisroelik..."
    el "Love... every Jew. What he is, where he is... doesn't matter. Love them all.... as yourself."
    yb "Yes, Tatti."
    el "Don't be afraid of... anything. Only fear... Hashem..."
    yb "Yes, Tatti."
    el "... and nothing else."
    yb "Yes."
    el "It's time for... me, now."
    yb "Tatti!"
    el "Yisroelik. Don't cry."
    yb "Tatti! No! Stay!"
    el "Shema, Yisro-eil... Adoynoy Eloiheinu... Adoynoy... echod...."
    yb "Tatti?"
    yb "TATTIII!!! No! Nooooo!"

    "Little Yisroel carried those lessons with him for the rest of his life." 
    "He treated everyone nicely and made friends with everyone. He would smile and cheer everyone up."
    "He loved everyone and everything, because they were all creations the Holy One, Blessed Be He; in each of there glowed the soul of life."
    "Another thing little Yisroel loved was meditating on the wonders of Creation."
    "Since he wasn't afraid of the forest, he liked going there alone to think about these things."
    "And that was how he met a hidden tsadik."
    "Thirty-six hidden {i}tsadikim{/i} are alive at all times, scattered around the world." 
    "They exist to fight evil, and to serve as a beacon of hope for the downtrodden."
    "The entire World exists in their merit, for it is through their mighty efforts that the Scales of Justice balance, ever so finely."
    "Rabbi Shlomo Zalmen was one of these heroes, and he met little Yisroel one day as the boy wandered in the forest."
    
    yb "{i}Sholom aleichem!{/i}"
    # sz = Shlomo Zalmen
    sz "{i}Aleichem sholom!{/i} What are you doing in the forest alone?"
    yb "Just hiking a bit."
    sz "Hiking? There are wild animals here. Aren't you afraid?"
    yb "No. Tatti told me not to be afraid of anything, except for HaKodosh Boruch Hu."
    sz "Oh? Where is your tatti?"
    yb "......"
    sz "What's his name?"
    yb "... E- Eliezer."
    sz "Oh... Eliezer. I'm sorry."
    yb "It's alright."
    sz "He was a great man, and a good friend."
    yb "......"
    sz "Do you want to learn something with me?"

    yb "Hmm... {i}Rabi Chizkiya posach, k'siv k'shoishana bayn ha-choichim...{/i}"
    
    "Seeing that Yisroel had such a special soul, Rabbi Shlomo decided to take care of Yisroel. From then on, wherever Rabbi Shlomo Zalmen went, little Yisroel went, too."
    zu "In time, Yisroel learned the keys to finding the Secret of Secrets."
    pn "Teacher?"
    zu "Hmm?"
    pn "What was the Secret?"
    zu "What was the Secret, you ask?"
    zu "... I can't tell you. It's a Secret!"
    pn "Aww..."
    zu "I'm sorry, Pinny."
    zu "Maybe you'll grow up and learn the Secret yourself!"
    pn "... Oh!"
    "Pinny brightens up."
    zu "Later, when Yisroel became the Baal Shem Tov, he spread holy knowledge, good deeds and happiness all over the world. Those things sustain and illuminate the Earth today!"
    zu "The story, though, doesn't end there. His mission was to bring the {i}Moshiach.{/i}"
    zu "{i}Melech HaMoshiach{/i} didn't come then."
    zu "But, he is very close today."
    zu "Just do one more {i}mitzvah,{/i} and you could tip the scales to bring {i}Moshiach{/i} right now!"
    zu "Alkay, {i}kinderlech.{/i} That's all for today! You can go!"

    "All my friends run to the field to play soccer."
    "I'm about to join them, when I remember my question from earlier."

    me "Teacher?"
    zu "Ai?"
    me "My question from before... I meant, why did God put me here? I mean, not {i}here{/i}, but... in the world..."
    "Zusha's smile washes over me."
# [prz] This would be better served by a character emotion than narration. "Show, don't tell". You will have emotions for the characters anyway.
# -- [mus] Ditto before. Since I think almost every character will have a smile emotion, this is just a note to myself to switch from "attentive/stroke beard" to "smile".
    zu "Where do you get all these pesky questions?"
    "I giggle."
    zu "That's a gooood question. Everyone has a different mission here."
    zu "Like Yankel the policeman. He has to make sure everyone's homes are safe, day and night."
    zu "And Mendel the butcher! You know? He gives the poor people a share of meat every week, {i}kaynahora.{/i}"
    zu "Your mission, though. Hmmm-hm."

    "Zusha strokes his short, red beard."
# [prz] Same as my previous comment (stroke_beard will be an amusing emotion to have :D but I think it will probably occur often enough to have your artist draw it!)
# -- [mus] ditto previous.

    zu "Well, what would {i}you{/i} like to do?"

    me "I wanna be {i}tsadik{/i} just like little Yisroel!"

    "Zusha's eyes twinkle and he laughs. I pout."

    me "But I {b}do{/b} so wanna be a {i}tsadik!{/i}"

    "Zusha stops laughing, but he is still smiling. He puts his hand on my shoulder."

    zu "You want you should be a {i}tsadik?{/i}"

    "I nod eagerly."

    zu "Your mommy and tatti should be proud."
    zu "Go for it!"

    "I beam at him. Then I chase after my friends."

    me "Oi! Pinny! Yossi! Wait up!"

    pn "Yeah. Test it, then go ahead and tie it."
    me "How many hammocks do you think we can make?"

    "Back in kindergarten, he got in trouble because he took apart the teacher's chair with a screwdriver he brought that day."
    "He loves making pranks like that. So that he is always prepared, he carries around a combo tool with pliers, scissors, knives, screwdrivers, and other useful goodies."

    pn "Sure. Here."
