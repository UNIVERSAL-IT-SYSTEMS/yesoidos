    "We just sit there, me watching, Pinny whittling."

    me "Hey, Pinny? How do you find God?"
    "He stops whittling for a moment. Then, with a straight face -"
    pn "Well - God is a kind of invisible superman in the sky, and that's how He rules over everything."
    "I squint at him questioningly."
    pn "{b}NOT!!!{/b}"
    "We laugh together."
    me "But I mean for real!"
    pn "For real? Well, some guy once said, He's wherever you let Him in."
    me "So? How do I let Him in?"
    pn "Mitzvos, I guess."
    "I nod."
    me "That sounds about right."

    "My thoughts wander some more."
    me "I think being high up is kinda the same. Physically. Spiritually."
    pn "Huh-weah? Why?"
    me "Like, we are high up right now, right? Look how far you can see!"
    pn "Yeah! I can't see this much when I'm on the ground."
    me "Yeah. When you go higher, you can see more stuff all around."
    me "Maybe it's the same spiritually."
    # Actually, because, it's that way spiritually, it's the same way physically. This higher idea will appear later.
    pn "Eh-h-h."
    pn "Awesomeness."
    pn "Maybe that's why those older kids like the top bunk so much."
    me "It's like spiritually."
    pn "Yeah."
    "We both think some more."
    pn "You know..."
    pn "Maybe that's why we like climbing trees."
    
    "I take a peek at Pinny's carving. It looks like he made a case for a {i}mezuzah{/i} scroll. He is making really small shavings to smooth it out."
    
    me "Hey, Pinny?"
    pn "Ei?"
    me "We've gotta do this again!"
    "He flashes a huge grin and nods."
    pn "You're on!"
