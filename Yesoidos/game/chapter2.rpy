    "A few years have passed since Pinny and I made rope hammocks in the park trees."
    "We're still friends, but the world around us has... changed... a lot."
    "Zusha's {i}cheder{/i} group was never that large, and when all the kids got older, the community hired another teacher for us, replacing him."
    "So, Zusha moved to Oklahoma City, and we hardly heard from him again. I miss him a lot, and I'm sure Pinny does, too."
    "But that wasn't all."
    "When the recession hit, my dad lost his office job."
    "Without that income, my parents could no longer afford the tuition for a Jewish education."
    "So, when I was ten, I went into public school. It was a big shock."
    "Everyone was talking about what was \"in.\""
    "Being \"in\" was a concept that I had never seen or heard of before."
    "It seemed that to be \"in,\" you had to know the latest rap song and be able to break dance and play sports."
    "The values just seemed so hollow."
    "I didn't want to become like that."
    
    inner  "So what do you want to be?"
    "A tsadik."
    inner "You say that so easily. You think that {i}you{/i} can be a tsadik?"
    "I..."
    "I don't..."
    inner "Exactly. You don't know if it's even possible."
    inner "You puny speck of dust!"
    inner "Look at this darkness around you!"
    inner "How do you think you can overcome this?"
    inner "You are already overcome! Look at your sins!"
    "Please..."
    inner "Do you think that you are so holy?"
    "No..."
    inner "How many, how many?"
    inner "A hundred? A thousand? Ten thousand?"
    "NO!"
    inner "These sins here are only the ones you know about."
    inner "Just imagine the ones you {i}don't{/i} know about!"
    inner "Hopeless, no? Another here, another there..."
    "AAAAGH!!!"
    inner "And you want to be a tsadik?"
    inner "Ha!"
    inner "Ha! Ha! Hahahahaha!"
    me "NO!"
    "My darkened bedroom vibrates momentarily from my outburst."
    "Frightened a bit, I sit up in bed, hugging my knees. I hope I didn't wake my parents."
    "After waiting a bit, I hear nothing."
    "Nothing but the crickets outside, and the fridge motor running, far off in the kitchen."
    "That, and the tiny, high-pitched noise of blood rushing in my ears."
    "I can't seem to ever escape that little noise. It's never completely silent."
    "Just like this inner voice."
    "Always questioning. Doubting."
    inner "So what do you want to be?"
    "Repeating."
    "I try to figure out what to do about it."
    "Should I ignore it?"
    "It might die down eventually."
    "If I manage to outlast it."
    inner "So what do you want to be?"
    "But is the question it asks really bad?"
    inner "So what do you want to be?"
    "Wait. Is that really what it's asking?"
    "I already answered the question. I want to be a tsadik!"
    "What is that inner voice really asking?"
    "It has a problem with the answer I'm giving?"
    inner "Exactly."
    inner "You answered in words. Did you answer with your core?"
    "My core?"
    inner "I still heard doubt. Fear."
    "Fear..."
    "Yes, there is a fear there."
    "A fear that I could fail."
    "That I could be overcome."
    "A fear that this desire might never come to be."
    "A fear that I am hoping for too much."
    inner "You answered with words. Words are external."
    inner "Promises, promises. What about what will actually happen?"
    "What will actually happen?"
    inner "Words can lie."
    shout "{i}But not the core.{/i}"
    inner "Look into your core. Your inner self. What do you want?"
    inner "What do you see?"
    "Where is my core?"
    inner "Until your inner self is sure, your future will contain fear and doubt."
    "I rest my head against my knees and whisper into the darkness."
    me "God... God... Where is my core?"
    "The outside world fades from my consciousness, leaving only me."
    "My body dissolves away just like it."
    me "God... answer me..."
    "My mind floats through the darkness."
    "I see random colors speckling my vision. An orange web, with rough, angular shapes of green."
    me "Please, God..."
    me "Where am {i}I?{/i}"
    me "What am I?"
    "My perception of time broadens."
    me "What was/will be me?"
    "The darkness deepens. I see something."
    "It has no recognizable form. It's just floating in nothingness. Dark. So dark!"
    "But there is a little light coming from it."
    "A tiny light."
    "Motionless."
    "I will it to change, but nothing happens."
    "I strengthen my focus on it."
    "Still, nothing."
    me "How do I change it?"
    "Speckles fill my vision as I lose concentration."
    "A distant train horn sounds, and I hear the boxcars rattling over the tracks."
    "I open my eyes. I don't feel so tired."
    "I just feel lost. Something didn't click."
    "The alarm clock beside me glows 11:34 in red digits."
    "Despite my alertness, I get back under the covers and close my eyes."
    "I open then again. 11:34."
    "I close them for a while."
    "Then I open them. 11:37."
    "I shut them again."
    "11:40."
    "11:45."
    inner "Until your inner self is sure..."
    inner "...your future...."
    "The rest of the message is lost."
    "Except..."
    inner "What do you want to be?"
    "11:54."
    "I close my eyes again and focus on relaxing, not moving my body."
    "Sleep envelops me...."

    "The next day, the questions still echo in my mind."
    me "Do I even know what a tsadik is?"
    "I know what he does."
    "But, if words are external, what about actions?"
    "Compared to speech, aren't actions more external? Separated from the core?"
    "But then, aren't they also an expression of the internal?"
    "What a person felt so necessary that he brought it from potential to actual?"
    "What is the connection between speech and action?"
    "My thoughts wander through the labyrinth."
    "A tsadik won't lie."
    "In a tsadik, his inside and outside match."
    "His words and actions match his thoughts."
    "No."
    "It's much deeper than that."
    "Everything - his thoughts, speech and action - everything is aligned with his inner self."
    "A tsadik's inner self is sure. Firm."
    "Since his externality flows from that, so does his future."
    "Everything comes because of his pure inner core."
    "I guess that this is the soul."
    "But what of the question?"
    "How do I become like that?"
    shout "{i}How do I strengthen my inner self?{/i}"
    "How do I strengthen my soul?"
    "How do I give it direction?"
    "... And so the day wore on. The questions cycled in my mind."
    "They were still circling in my mind when I met Yossi."
    "Since Yossi lives nearby, we would see each other fairly often."
    "The conversation went something like this."

    "... That afternoon (after a {i}quick{/i} lunch), I took the one volume of Talmud my dad had, and tried to read it in Aramaic."

    me "{i}Sha... mm... mai? Om...er? Kol. Han...nashim?...{/i}"
    "It's just that I had absolutely no idea what I was reading at all."
    "But I kept reading."
    "For a while."
    "Then my eyelids began to droop."
    "And then I fell asleep on the couch."
    "I guess that I bit off more than I could chew."

    "Still, even though I didn't really get anything from that Talmud session on the couch..."
    "I'm glad I talked to Yossi."
    "He might not have answered my question."
    "But, I realized eventually that he introduced a new question, which I had a chance of answering."
    shout "Where can I find the answers?"
    "In other words, I wasn't alone. Others have come before me, seeking the same path."
    "People who have already done this would know."
    "Chochomim. Tzadikim."
    "They would have the answers."

    "Spurred by this thought, I continued learning Torah on my own."
    "Especially the Oral Traditions committed to writing by the chochomim and tsadikim of old."
    "At first, it was mostly stuff already translated into English."
    "I knew that it was filtered down a little bit, because the titles and authors clearly indicated their original language."
    "Pirkei Avos. Chovos Halevavos. Rambam. Rabi Yochanan ben Zakkai. Hillel."
    "While I did learn a fair deal, the English commentaries showed that there were thousands of nuances that could only be seen in the original language."
    "I longed to see all the nuances, as they were in the original."
    "When I got older, I would put one finger in the Hebrew and one finger in the English at the same time. Matching up the words helped me learn the language."
    "It was slow going, but I made some progress."
    "When I was twelve, I could understand about half of the siddur, or the Jewish prayerbook."
    "At thirteen, I knew about 75\%, and I could understand about half of the Chumash, the Five Books of Moses."
    "It helped a lot that the vocabulary of the Holy Tongue was very simple, with few extra frills."
    "Or so I thought."
    "Later books of the Writings and the Prophets were much more flowery and poetic, and I couldn't even tell what the topic was most of the time."
    "Still though, I stuck with it."
    "Maybe it was because I found Pirkei Avos in the siddur one day after davening."
    "It was a huge collection of Jewish aphorisms - it really got into human psychology, self-improvement and stuff like that."
    "Or maybe it was because I kept asking questions from the rabbi and kept getting answers."
    "I started feeling that no matter what the question, there was always an answer."
    "Even if the initial answer was \"I don't know,\" I usually found the answer somewhere, sometime later on."
    "Maybe it was just that there were entire fields of Jewish knowledge that I had no idea about, like Talmud and Kabbalah."
    "The possibilities and knowledge just waiting out there made me want to go out and get it for myself."
    "But at the same time as I was exhilarated by the knowledge, I was also in awe and a bit of fear of it."
    "There is a story about this in the Talmud."

    #Scene change here to indicate the beginning of a story
    "There are four levels of understanding Torah; four different realms."
    "There is P'shat, Remez, Drush and Sod. All of them can be true at the same time."
    "P'shat is the plain meaning of the verse."
    "Remez is allusion, which links the verses in different places together."
    "Drush is more esoteric, explaining the finer hinting of the words in the Torah. Often, this contains the stories in between the lines of the Torah."
    "Sod is the deepest and most esoteric aspect of the Torah. Few people are privileged to learn it."
    "Sod means \"secret.\""
    "It covers the mystical aspects of Torah."
    "Together, these four layers of understanding are abbreviated as PaRDeS."
    "Says the Talmud:"
    "\"There were four men that entered Pardes.\""
    "\"They were Ben Azai, Ben Zoma, Acher, and Rabbi Akiva.\""
    "\"He said to them:\""
    "\'When you reach the pure marble stones, do not say, \"Water, water!\"\'"
    "\'For it is said, \"One who speaks falsehood will not be guiltless in My eyes.\"\'"
    "\"Ben Azai peered in and died.\""
    "\"Scripture says of him, \'Precious in the eyes of God is the death of His pious.\'\""
    "\"Ben Zoma peered in and became insane.\""
    "\'Scripture says of him, \"Have you found honey? Eat what is enough for you, so that you not be filled with it and vomit it.\'\""
