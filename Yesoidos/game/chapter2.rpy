    "A few years have passed since Pinny and I made rope hammocks in the park trees."
    "We're still friends, but the world around us has... changed... a lot."
    "Zusha's {i}cheder{/i} group was never that large, and when all the kids got older, the community hired another teacher for us, replacing him."
    "So, Zusha moved to Oklahoma City, and we hardly heard from him again. I miss him a lot, and I'm sure Pinny does, too."
    "But that wasn't all."
    "When the recession hit, my dad lost his office job."
    "Without that income, my parents could no longer afford the tuition for a Jewish education."
    "So I went into public school. It was a big shock."
    "To be considered \"in\" over there (which in itself was a concept that I had never seen or heard of before),"
    "... you had to know the latest rap song and be able to break dance."
    "The values just seemed so hollow."
    "I didn't want to become like that."
    "So, on my own, I began to study the Torah."
    "Mostly, it was stuff in English."
    
    "Since Yossi lived nearby, we would see each other fairly often."
    "One of those conversations went something like this."
    me "Hi Yossi!"
    ys "Benny!"
    me "How do you become a tsadik?"
    "A pause."
    ys "Hic?"
    "Uh-oh. I got his hiccups started."
    ys "Ahhh-hic-hic."
    me "Oh, no."
    ys "Don't wo- *hic* worry about it. Hic."
    me "Breathe slowly."
    ys "Hic."
    "An ice cream later, he was back to normal."
    ys "Hah-h-h. Thanks, Benny."
    me "No problem!"
    me "{i}Boruch atoh adoinoi, eloheinu melech haölom, boirei nefashos rabos v'chesroinon al kol mo sheboroso lehachayois bohem nefesh kol chai.{/i}"
    ys "What're you saying?"
    me "{i}Boruch chei haölomim.{/i} -For the ice cream pop."
    ys "You say a brocho after ice cream?"
    me "Yeah. I just noticed it in the bentsher yesterday, after the \"Grace After Meals.\""
    ys "You mean, \"bentshing\"?"
    me "Yeah."
    ys "That sounds so Shakespeare!"
    me "Yeah, doesn't it?"
    ys "It's like \"Tabernacle\" for \"Mishkan\" and, em, what do they call the menorah?"
    me "Candelabrum. Isn't that so over-the-top?"
    ys "I know! Why can't they just use {i}normal English?{/i}"
    "We both laugh, but I stop quickly."
    me "Hey, don't get the hiccups again, unless you want to get the ice cream this time!"
    ys "Hahaha! Hic!"
    me "{b}NO-O-O!{/b} Not the hiccups again!"
    ys "Haha-*hic*-haha-*hic*!"
    "Yossi was a good sport and bought the next round of ice creams."
    me "So what do you think about the question from before?"
    ys "Hmmm. Oh, the tzadik thing?"
    me "Yeah."
    ys "I guess you gotta be a Talmud chochem."
    "A chochem is a scholar."
    me "So, I've gotta study Talmud?"
    ys "Yeah."
    me "Hmmm."
    me "Oh! It's lunchtime!"
    "Yossi's mom was mostly strict about one thing, and that was mealtimes."
    ys "You're right! Gotta go!"
    me "See you later, Yossi!"
    ys "Bye!"
    "That afternoon, I took the one volume of Talmud my dad had, and tried to read it in Aramaic."
    "It had the vowels added in, so the sounding out the words wasn't too hard."
    "It's just that I had absolutely no idea what I was reading at all."
    "So I fell asleep."
    "I guess that I bit off more than I could chew."
    "From then on, I stuck with the English."
    "When I got older, I put a finger in the Hebrew and a finger in the English to match up the words and learn them when I had time."
