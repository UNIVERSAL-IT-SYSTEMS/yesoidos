Following is a fairly detailed outline of the story. The lengths of the sections here do not necessarily reflect the section lengths in the actual novel, as certain parts may be vastly expanded or trimmed from their form here. For example, Section I is approximately 4000 words long in the novel. Some parts of Section II here do not become apparent until later on in the novel, while other bits are only hinted at in the dialog. Etcetera.

## 0) The Beginning
Exciting creation scene. Show the creation of the letters, the Divine Will, Time, existence from nothing, the concealment of the light in the first tzimtzum, sheviras hakeilim, the six days of creation. Fade to...

## I) Early Years
Classroom scene with Zusha. Introduce Binyomin's goals.

The first part of the story introduces the main characters as children. We see that both Binyomin and Pinchas are interested in reaching spiritual heights, and they are close friends. They learn together, build things together, grow together.

The metaphor of the tree to spiritual growth is introduced.

## II) The Training

However, things happen. Binyomin's father loses his job, and can no longer afford to send him to yeshiva, so Binyomin ends up in public school. However, he can still see his neighbor Yossi, another old friend. At this time, Binyomin begins communing with his soul and develops a desire to see into the other worlds. In order to achieve this, he begins learning Torah on his own.

Pinchas on the other hand remains in a Jewish school, where he is a leading student. Very ambitious, he develops an interest in Kabbalah, and in secret, he begins to search for practical techniques to access the spiritual worlds like Binyomin. However, the power begins to intoxicate him, and he grows arrogant.

When Pinchas and Binyomin meet after a long separation, it is in the synagogue's library. Binyomin is studying Pirkei Avos, but Pinchas looks dismissively at it, calling it "basic" and "watered-down." An argument follows, where Pinchas tells Binyomin that, while he believes the sages of the Mishnah were very smart, they were too afraid to reveal more powerful knowledge, so they hid what they knew and only wrote down very simple concepts. Pinchas accuses them of "pulling the wool over your eyes," which upsets Binyomin a lot. Yossi interrupts the conversation, taking them all to get ice cream, where things cool down somewhat. Yossi tries to get the other two to reminisce about their kindergarten days, which helps some, but there is still tension. Their parting is lukewarm. Over the next couple years, they meet a few more times, but Pinchas changes so much and becomes so overbearing that their friendship falls apart. Over that time, Pinchas begins to separate himself from the traditions of the Torah, suggesting that because "the ends justify the means" the mitsvos could be replaced.

Zusha, who still attends Binyomin's shul, notices that Binyomin is not feeling well. After hearing what has happened to Pinchas, Zusha tries contacting him again and again, but fails. In the meantime, he settles Binyomin's mind by resolving Pinchas' challenges and teaching him Chassidus.

Chassidus opens up a new world for Binyomin, revealing how high a human can reach and revealing new depths of G‑d's Infiniteness. Binyomin learns quickly.

At the synagogue one Shabbos, Binyomin's father tells his son that he wants to give him a present - a trip to Israel! This surprises and delights Binyomin, who now eagerly begins packing up for his summer trip. He has some inkling that this is a very special event, and he notices a new brightness in his soul.

During his trip, he detects a special aura in the air, and a feeling of significance in the very soil. Every day, he feels energized, needing less sleep, cracking jokes with his newfound friends. In this joyful state, he achieves prophecy for the first time.

While still in Israel, Binyomin hears a voice calling to him in a dream. It sounds like his father, but he knows that his father is still in America. Confused, he wakes up. Not seeing anyone aside from his bunk-mate, he goes back to sleep. 

But, Binyomin hears the voice again and wakes up. It sounds real, but there is no one around. The third time, he also wakes up his bunk-mate, who sleepily tells him to go back to sleep, and "If it's not a bad dream, why don't you just talk with it?…"

Something about this whole situation reminds Binyomin about Samuel the Prophet, so he tries to talk with the voice. The voice then tells him to undertake a challenge: bring Pinchas back to the light. The next morning, Pinchas makes the necessary arrangements to return home.

## III) Darkness

When the erstwhile friends meet again, Binyomin discovers that Pinchas has gone further over to the Other Side. Although Pinchas doesn't reveal everything that he has been doing, Binyomin can tell that his logic and morals are becoming more and more warped. Condescending as ever, Pinchas dismisses Binyomin as dogmatic and small-minded, telling him that in order to stop human suffering, they must sever their dependence on G‑d, who hasn't been helping them. Throughout, Pinchas speaks of freedom from "arbitrary" Divine punishment and self-determination. In the end, he talks about "easier, more reliable ways" to ensure wealth and happiness - using unholy spirits and demons. It is obvious that he feels he is in the right. Binyomin becomes frightened and ends the conversation.

Binyomin departs from Pinchas in a state of confusion and shock. He is tortured by the discord in his friend's mind and soul, and finds that he can no longer receive visions from G‑d. Hoping to settle his mind enough to receive Divine guidance once more, Binyomin enters a yeshiva to calm himself. Over the course of a month, he finds his inner balance again, making friends with the others in the yeshiva. He decides to stay there for an extended period, experiencing the farbrengens, the mivtzoim and even a trip to Brooklyn.

Spending more time in yeshiva, he achieves prophecy several times. Sometimes they occur in dreams; other times when he is awake. Several times, he prophesies about an age of darkness and terror, followed by light. Other times, an angel (later revealed to be Elijah) comes and teaches him all sorts of knowledge about this world and the worlds above, such as the 70 languages, how to recognize spiritual danger, how to heal the ailments of the body, and how to enter the heavenly academy at will.

Upon leaving yeshiva, Binyomin is given semicha as a rabbi. He then goes into intensive training with a senior rabbi to achieve a higher level of semicha, that of yodin yodin.

## IV) Exile

In the meantime, drunk on his power, Pinchas is putting his plan to rebel against G‑d into action. After learning techniques of sorcery and fortune-telling in the Caribbean and spirit enchantments in India, he begins using his new abilities. In secret, he gathers an army of sorcerers, necromancers and the like in order to secure his magical powers over the physical world and get independence from G‑d.

As part of his plan, Pinchas has one of his followers start a Movement of Atheist Activists, whose mission is ostensibly to weaken and stop any religious groups from pursuing their agenda. Unbeknownst to the members, Pinchas is actually manipulating their actions behind the scenes to provide energy for black magic. Rumors of strange, violent beasts from the wilderness begin to appear, followed by others of mysterious freak accidents, deaths, men cloaked in black, and a new, powerful order called the "Legion of Darkness."

For a while, Pinchas is successful. But then, he makes a mistake: In the middle of trying to enslave an angel, he mispronounces a mystical formula, killing his assistants around him and putting himself into a coma. When neighbors and the police investigate, they discover the bodies in the signature black cloaks of the Legion, surrounded by flasks of congealed human blood, spices and mystical diagrams. Although the police confirm to the media that two dead adult males and one unconscious man were found, they suppress all other information.

Hearing from Elijah the Prophet that his childhood friend is in the hospital, Binyomin immediately goes to see Pinchas, who is still in a coma. Binyomin is still unaware of how deeply Pinchas has descended, and after reviving him, Binyomin tries to find out what happened. At first, Pinchas lies to Binyomin, but Binyomin sees through the deception. Finally recognizing how far Binyomin has advanced in his knowledge of the spirits, Pinchas compliments Binyomin and tells him the whole truth. He tries to recruit Binyomin into the Legion, but Binyomin, pained and shocked, refuses and leaves the hospital.

The police, who were listening in on the conversation, ask to talk to Binyomin afterwards, but Binyomin asks for some time to calm down and set his thoughts in order. 

In a park, Binyomin sits on a bench and begins to deliberate. Should he turn in his friend, or not? Should he tell the truth, or not? He realizes that the police heard their conversation, so lying about it would be extremely difficult. What would the government do if they caught him? At this point, they would probably just imprison him for a few decades. If they didn't catch him… he shudders to think of what Pinchas might do later, and to what depths he would sink, and how many souls he might ensnare. His mind made up, he meets with the police to tell them what he knows.

However, when he arrives at the station, he prophetically realizes that the officer assigned to the case is a member of the Legion. Realizing that this was determined by G‑d, who gave him a mission as a prophet, and that G‑d will protect him and bring his mission success, Binyomin continues with the interview as if nothing was wrong.

After the interview is over, the officer tells Binyomin that he is under arrest on suspicion of assisted murder. "First of all, neither of you are from this town. How did you know that Pinchas was here, of all places? And, furthermore, that he was involved with this incident? The police department did not release any information identifying him except for the location of the house. Therefore, you must have known what he was going to do before the incident happened. When you denied foreknowledge of this, you must have been lying, so I have reasonable suspicion that you are his accomplice. Put your hands up and face the wall."

The officer then handcuffs Binyomin and leads him out of the interview room. But then, while opening a door, the officer pulls a muscle in his back, falling to one knee in pain. Another officer comes to help him. "Is the interview finished?" asks the new officer. "Yes," answers Binyomin. "OK then. You can go on ahead to security down the hall to your right and check out." "Thanks," says Binyomin. "Oh, officer?" he says to the Legion member. "I think you dropped this." Binyomin hands the handcuffs (which have somehow become unlocked) over to their owner. For a moment, the officer looks confused. "Didn't I just…" he pauses, and his expression turns to one of gratitude, although he is still in pain. "Uh, thanks. Um, have a good day!" Leaning on his colleague, he walks away, and Binyomin leaves the station. 

While passing the recording room, he overhears a conversation:
"... It crashed again?"
"Yeah, while the interview was going."
"Geez." 
"Well, we didn't lose the whole recording. Just the last few seconds..."

Afterwards, Binyomin gets a call from the police again. During the interview, Pinchas escaped from the hospital, despite increased police security around him. Because the old officer got injured, a new officer was assigned to the case. He asks Binyomin if he has any ideas about where Pinchas may have gone, to which Binyomin suggests that the officer who interviewed him might know something. After this, the police cooperate with Binyomin, and a mutual respect develops between them.

Now that the Legion of Darkness is being forced to lay low, Binyomin realizes that he must fight Pinchas' movement. However, he knows that his powers are still not strong enough to fight the Legion, so he approaches Zusha again for help, who agrees to join him and help guide his way.

## VI) Light

As Binyomin's knowledge and powers grow, he gathers a following of his own. The group dubs itself the "Defenders of Light." They treat Binyomin as their rabbi and spiritual leader, and he personally teaches the most intelligent and promising of his followers about the secrets of Kabbalah. Gradually, he trains a group of highly disciplined men skilled in the use of Divine Names. Other followers are taught to perform mitzvos with special intentions in order to strengthen the forces of good, and to spread the performance of the mitzvos as much as possible. Zusha acts as a guide for these followers, forwarding difficult problems on to Binyomin himself.

Part of Binyomin's approach to leadership is not just to merely get followers, but to make his followers leaders themselves. These men are to make other people leaders in turn. Thus, the Defenders grow.

Part of the requirements to becoming a prophet is that one must be physically strong and wealthy. Soon after the Defenders of Light are first organized, Yossi, Binyomin's old friend comes and joins them. Having trained in martial arts for many years, his slight pudginess has been absorbed by his muscle, and he aids the Defenders by providing them with martial training.

However, all through this process, the emphasis is on performing mitzvos, because it is G‑d that guarantees success: "If G‑d doesn't build the house, for naught to its builders labor."

## VII) Birth-pangs

Finally, the Legion of Darkness makes their first move. Coming out of hiding, they begin to attract new members with public exhibitions of their powers. Although the police try to arrest them, they find little success, because the Legion members use magical means to escape. In addition, the police itself has been infiltrated by the Legion, as Binyomin has already discovered. In the meantime, all sorts of people interested in attaining magical powers join the Legion.

This movement elicits the ire of various religious groups, some of whom take violent action against suspected Legion members. When the Legion responds in kind, many attribute the violence to religious extremism and conclude that it is better to not belong to any religion or cult at all. This swells the numbers of the MAA.

Then comes a flood of demons over the country. At first, they make the headlines. The cloaked Legion members are able to command them to rape, steal and kill as they wish. Soon, however, the demons become so commonplace that the vast majority of their deeds never make it to the newspapers. There are just too many of them.

There follows a period of war between the Defenders of Light and the Legion of Darkness. Pinchas' army perpetrates all sorts of crimes against humanity in order to draw holy energies into evil, while Binyomin's forces bolster the hopes of the innocent, teaching them how to fight the darkness.

Now, with demons and golems, sorcery and Kabbalah all around them, no one can stay impartial about it. They don't feel safe in their own homes. The MAA largely falls apart, but most of them feel too much animosity towards spiritualists in general to join either the Legion or the Defenders. On the other hand, many people only joined the Legion out of fear, bearing little real loyalty to Pinchas's group. Some of these become spies and report on the Legion's movements to the Defenders of Light.

Nations around the world ally themselves with the two groups, launching a multi-national war.

In the final conflicts, Binyomin defeats Pinchas one-on-one. However, Binyomin refuses to kill him, and shows how Pinchas made a critical mistake in the logic that led him down his dark path. Realizing the magnitude of his error, Pinchas gives up hope that he, or the world, could ever return to the light, but Binyomin tells him otherwise: "The greatest Light is the Light that comes from Darkness itself." At this, Pinchas rejoins Binyomin on the side of holiness, and orders the Legion of Darkness to surrender. Although there is a fierce struggle with the remnants of the Legion of Darkness, it is eventually subdued....

## VIII) Revelation

The sun rises on a broken, ruined world. The Defenders of Light have attained peace and victory, but at a heavy toll.  The Legion's nefarious deeds have left so many dead that they must be buried in mass graves, and the rivers run red with blood. The diseased and maimed are so numerous that they overflow the hospitals that remain standing, forcing volunteers to lay them on the ground under crude, hastily-built shelters. Golems are employed to help with the recovery, but there aren't enough supplies to treat everyone.

At this point, Binyomin releases a message for worldwide broadcast. In a sensitive, yet compelling and rousing address directed to the "children of Noah, who rebuilt the world after it was erased by the waters of destruction," he calls on everyone to observe a moment of silence. "Let our thoughts be with those who passed on, with those who sacrificed their lives, in order that good survive them and give light to the world. It is our mission to make sure that their wish becomes reality. That this war be the last war. That the nations shall beat their swords into plowshares, and that the sheep shall lay down by the lion."

In the middle of the live broadcast, Binyomin suddenly stops, and looks to the side, and nods his head in recognition before stepping to side. Elijah the prophet suddenly appears in a bright flame on camera. He announces that, as one who has received the tradition of ordination in a direct chain from Moses, he is hereby conferring semicha on Binyomin. After Binyomin, in turn, confers semicha on the 70 greatest and wisest of his Defenders, Elijah announces to the newly-formed Sanhedrin that the Moshiach is here.
